      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Show the entire map so that you can see comparison with other states changes in number of abortion clinics <b>(1)</b>: At first I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to show all of the states in my map or just the southern states, but I think showing all the states allows for the reader to have a better idea of how other states in the country were doing in terms of changes in the number of abortion clinics. I think this helps get my point across because it allows for a broader understanding of where the Southern states are situated in relation to the rest of the country and helps the reader identify other geographic patterns from the data. </li>
				<li>Using a color scheme that allows for quick differentiation of differences <b>(1)</b>: I used a color scheme that allowed for the reader to quickly make inferences about the data due to the high contrast (dark orange being lower numbers or associated with poor findings, and blue being associated with better findings or an increase in the measure). By making this decision, readers are able to follow traditional conventions and not be confused about how they read the data, without the map using really non-neutral colors. I thought about doing steps for the scale so there was less variance in how the states were displayed, but I think that would just make the data less transparent and also harder to distinguish key patterns in the data. I did make a small change to where the scale started so instead of -67% it starts at -65% so that it starts at an integer of 5. </li>
				<li>Marked which states were considered Southern and noted my methodology <b>(2)</b>: Most of the transparency in this map came from the annotations I made. I wanted to make sure that the reader understood that I did not make up the categorizations of the South, and so I noted the methodology I used came from the CDC. I think this makes the data more persuasive because it shows that my categorization of the data is coming from a reputable source. Additionally, on the map I wanted to show which states I wanted to highlight, so I marked them with a small white asterisk so the audience knew which states I wanted us to consider for our proposition. I do wish that Tableau had a better way of grouping specific geographies visually while also maintaining the other surrounding states for comparison.</li>
                <li>Made note that Trump presidency ended in 2021 not 2020 so might not capture all data <b>(1)</b>: I wanted to be transparent that this map may not show all relevant data since the Trump presidency ran from 2017-2021. This may help the reader trust the data more since I am acknowledging any missing data and acknowledging that, although unlikely, there could be some discrepancies with what actually happened in relation to percent change in abortion clinics during the Trump presidency. </li>
                <li>Made note that metric used was being used a proxy for abortion access <b>(2)</b>: I made a note that acknowledges that percent change in abortion clinics really stands in as a proxy for abortion access. I think this is helpful for the readers because it acknowledges any bias I may have and indicates that there may be additional factors that influence abortion access in the states of interest. </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Using metrics that are not necessarily comparable and not making a note of it <b>(-1)</b>: I chose these two metrics because to a lay audience I think they would seem comparable, although from a data perspective they might not be totally comparable since one is looking at providers and one is looking at clinics. If I wanted to be transparent, I would make a note of this discrepancy on the visualization. I still wanted to have metrics that were aligned with my proposition and weren’t totally off base from measuring abortion access, but may also be dependent on other factors such as population of 15-44 year olds in that state. 
                </li>
				<li>Making a map with colors that are reversed (darker as a lower percentage and lighter as a higher percentage) <b>(-2)</b>: By not following conventions for colors being darker to indicate higher value and lighter for lower values, it makes the reader automatically assume that the colors mean the opposite of what they are representing. I think this is effective because unless the reader is paying close attention to the key, they would assume that Florida and Maryland have the highest percentage of women living in counties without abortion. I thought I could achieve this level of intransparency by only playing with the color palette, but to really get a different read of the data it was best to reverse the color scale. </li>
				<li>Using a color palette which is a spectrum of similar colors that are hard to distinguish between <b>(-2)</b>: To really make my point that these states did not lose access during the presidency, I used a color palette (scale) that did not have a ton of variation between colors. This made my map more persuasive because it was harder to tell the difference between the metrics from 2014 to 2020 for each state or even between states; this made the point that the states kept roughly the same abortion access pre-Trump to towards the end of his presidency, although in reality many of them did fall in the percent of women (15-44) having access to abortions in their county. </li>
                <li>For comparison I used maps of time periods before and during presidency <b>(1)</b>: I think that using maps is a really helpful and persuasive method of visualization because it makes it easier for the reader to visualize the data spatially and since I am trying to convey data about specific geographies, using a map worked well. Especially when trying to compare the data over two years (sort of like a pre and post presidency comparison) using maps allows the reader to make quick comparisons between the geographies over time. However, the order in which they get read might be a bit deceptive since it is reading as 2020 first and 2014 second, and the title for the visualization may make it less clear what measures are being compared. </li>
                <li>Sorting for Southern states and not including the other states in map for comparison <b>(-1)</b>: To construe the data presented in the map, I filtered only for the Southern states and did show the other states on the map for comparison. I wanted to make sure that the reader did not have a comparison with other states to see how poor access in these states was and so it normalized the findings for the Southern states. Additionally, I did not include my methodology for which states were considered to be in the South. </li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>The process of making these visualizations was harder than I anticipated, I think partly because some of the metrics I was looking at using were not very comparable and did not necessarily address the issue of abortion access I wanted to cover. Additionally, I found it much harder to make a very transparent and convincing visualization of the Pro argument, despite me truly believing the argument. This may be because of my desire to make it very clear to the audience that I was not trying to pull wool over their eyes and persuade/manipulate them to believe the argument. I think in the case of the argument against my proposition, I found it easier to make visual decisions that either actively distorted the data, or did not show a full picture of what was happening as a comparison for the Southern states. I had a harder time than expected making critical data visualizations decisions, and ultimately decided to stick to more simple but effective data visualizations which allow ease of interpretation. </p>
    <p> In this process I was able to define ethical analysis and visualization being transparent with the audience about not only your sources of data and your methodologies, but also potentially your potential biases or limitations when working with the data. I think it is also good when thinking about ethical data visualizations to include some context about other factors that may be influencing the data or the findings. Ultimately, I think that what may be considered ethical is totally dependent on the person creating the visualization–it will be impossible to totally get rid of bias from visualizations, however, I think it is important to consider that a person’s live experience and beliefs will influence their moral compass and how that is translated into their data visualizations. I think that the difference between acceptable persuasive choices versus misleading ones comes down to including some notes about methodology, as well as providing context so that you are not the ultimate source of truth. Additionally, although we are allowed as data visualization creators to have artistic liberty, I think there are certain conventions of data visualizations that should be upheld (how color is perceived, not inverting scales, showing labels, numeric values being along a consistent scale). If these conventions are actively avoided or defied when creating visualizations, I think this leads to purposeful manipulation or persuasion of an audience who might not have enough information to form their own opinion.  While it is not steadfast rule to follow data visualization conventions, I do think it reduces the opportunity for a visualization to be considered misleading.</p>
